//vector<int> v = {1,2,3};
//string s = "Hello";

//v.size();    // 3 → number of elements in vector
//s.size();    // 5 → number of characters in string
//s.length();  // 5 → same as s.size() for string
//{} → initializes containers like vector, array, struct
//[] → used only for indexing/accessing elements, not for creating vectors
//But for vectors, .length() ❌ does not exist.
